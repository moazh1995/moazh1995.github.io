## Welcome to my CPIT 490 Team # Final Project ( SMART NEIGHBORS)


 1.	The original idea.

Our idea to build an application to let you borrow stuff from your neighbors. There is many stuff in our houses that we rarely use such as booster cable, drill, ladder and so on. We use these stuff maybe once every 6-months so instead of buying it we should borrow it.

 2.	The team effort breakdown: who did what?
 
 - Hassan Almalki mainly worked on the coding
 - Moaz Habib and Osama Barmiem worked on the Design and Report.
